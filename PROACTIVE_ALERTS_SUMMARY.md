# Proactive Alerts System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the existing news and weather agent system to include comprehensive proactive alerts with staggered timing to prevent all messages from being sent simultaneously.

## New Features Added

### 1. Weather Alert Functions
- **`check_and_alert_for_weather_user()`**: Monitors weather conditions in user's location
- **`check_and_alert_for_weather_bot()`**: Monitors weather conditions in bot's location
- **`is_interesting_weather()`**: Determines if weather conditions warrant an alert (storms, extreme temperatures, etc.)

### 2. Enhanced News Alert Functions
- **`check_and_alert_for_major_events_user()`**: Checks for major news events in user's location
- **`check_and_alert_for_major_events_bot()`**: Checks for major news events in bot's location
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing `check_and_alert_for_major_events()` function

### 3. Staggered Scheduling System
- **`get_staggered_delay()`**: Creates deterministic pseudo-random delays based on user email and bot ID
- **`should_send_proactive_message()`**: Prevents spam by checking if enough time has passed since last message
- **`send_staggered_proactive_messages()`**: Orchestrates all proactive alerts with proper delays

## Scheduling Intervals

### Proactive Alert Types:
1. **Weather Alerts (User Location)**: Every 12 hours, spread over 6 hours
2. **Weather Alerts (Bot Location)**: Every 12 hours, spread over next 6 hours  
3. **News Alerts (User Location)**: Every 8 hours, spread over 4 hours
4. **News Alerts (Bot Location)**: Every 8 hours, spread over next 4 hours
5. **Weekly News Summary**: Every 7 days (existing)

### Main Scheduler:
- **Staggered Proactive Alerts**: Runs every 4 hours to trigger the above alerts

## Time Gap Implementation

### Deterministic Staggering:
- Uses MD5 hash of `user_email + bot_id` to create consistent delays
- Same user-bot pairs always get same delay timing
- Different pairs get spread across time windows to avoid simultaneous messages

### Spam Prevention:
- Tracks last message timestamps in database
- Enforces minimum intervals between proactive messages of same type
- Uses message content markers (`[WEATHER_USER]`, `[NEWS_BOT]`, etc.) for tracking

## New API Endpoints

### Manual Testing Endpoints:
- `POST /run_staggered_proactive_alerts` - Trigger all staggered alerts
- `POST /run_weather_alerts_user` - Test weather alerts for user locations
- `POST /run_weather_alerts_bot` - Test weather alerts for bot locations  
- `POST /run_news_alerts_bot` - Test news alerts for bot locations

### Existing Endpoints (Enhanced):
- `POST /run_weekly_summary` - Weekly news summaries
- `POST /run_major_event_alert` - Major event alerts (user location)

## Database Integration

### Message Tracking:
- Uses existing `message_paritition` table
- Adds message type markers for tracking different alert types
- Implements time-based filtering to prevent duplicate messages

### User-Bot Pair Detection:
- Automatically detects user-bot pairs from conversations that happened today only
- Fetches user and bot details from `user_details` and `bot_personality_details` tables

## Key Benefits

1. **No Message Flooding**: Staggered delays prevent all users receiving alerts simultaneously
2. **Smart Timing**: Different alert types spread across different time windows
3. **Spam Protection**: Minimum intervals prevent excessive messaging
4. **Scalable**: Works for any number of user-bot pairs
5. **Testable**: Manual endpoints for testing individual alert types
6. **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality remains unchanged

## Configuration

### Alert Thresholds:
- Weather: Storms, extreme temperatures, weather warnings
- News: Political events, economic crises, disasters, major incidents

### Timing Configuration:
- Base intervals can be adjusted in the scheduling functions
- Stagger windows can be modified in `get_staggered_delay()`
- Minimum intervals configurable in `should_send_proactive_message()`

## Usage

The system automatically starts when the FastAPI application launches. All scheduled tasks are registered as startup event handlers and will run according to their configured intervals.

For manual testing or debugging, use the provided API endpoints to trigger specific alert types on demand.

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the system is working:

```bash
python test_proactive_alerts.py
```

This will test:
1. Today's user-bot pair detection
2. Parameter retrieval
3. Staggered delay calculation
4. Spam prevention logic
5. Full proactive message system

## Recent Fixes

### Fixed Issues:
1. **Async Function**: Made `scheduled_staggered_proactive_alerts()` async to properly handle async operations
2. **Message Pattern Matching**: Fixed message type patterns in `should_send_proactive_message()` to match actual message prefixes
3. **User Detection**: Uses today's user-bot pairs only for proactive messaging
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and logging throughout the system

### System Status:
âœ… **Ready for Production**: All proactive messages should now work correctly with proper staggered timing and spam prevention.
